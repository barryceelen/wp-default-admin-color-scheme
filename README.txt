Select a default admin color scheme for new and existing users. Optionally disable the color scheme picker to force a color scheme for all users.

== Description ==

Select a default admin color scheme for new and existing users. Optionally disable the color scheme picker to force a color scheme for all users.

By default, WordPress uses the ‘Default’ color scheme unless a user has selected another color scheme on their profile settings page.

Default Admin Color Scheme adds a color scheme picker to the ‘General’ settings page where you can change the default color scheme for all users.

### Force an admin color scheme for all users?

An additional option allows you to remove the admin color scheme picker from each user's ‘Profile’ settings page. Using this option results in all users seeing the same color scheme in the WordPress admin.
